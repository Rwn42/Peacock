This branch is a WIP rewrite of the Python codebase to TypeScript.
I switched to TypeScript because Pythons static typing was becoming frusterating and I wanted a reason
to try the new bun JavaScript runtime. I still plan on rewriting the compiler in a compiled language.

## Current Improvements over Python Implementation
- speed
- negative numbers lexed correctly
- CLI
