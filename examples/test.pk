extern puts(x ^int, y int)

proc main() do
    if 2 == 2 do
        return 4 2 +
    end
    my_var: ^int = 10
    my_var = 100
end

my_var: String = "Hello, World!"

similiar to two except my_var would contain a pointer to linear memory that holds
the string length and after it holds the string itself.

since we know this stuff at comptime when we create our data section it would look as follows
(data (i32.const 2) "hi" (i32.const 3) "hey")

therefore String is really just an int^ or i32 instead of some sort of structure type
