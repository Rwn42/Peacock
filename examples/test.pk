# my_var: String = "Hello, World!"
# #idea 3
# similiar to two except my_var would contain a pointer to linear memory that holds
# the string length and after it holds the string itself.

# since we know this stuff at comptime when we create our data section it would look as follows
# (data (i32.const 2) "hi" (i32.const 3) "hey")

# therefore String is really just an int^ or i32 instead of some sort of structure type
